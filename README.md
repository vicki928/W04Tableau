# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
### Turning data into easily consumable visual insights using Tableau

### Creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions based on business questions

### Communicating insights with the correct visualizations Instruction

## Process
### Step 1:  Downland the data from the Google drive link
### Step 2: Detect different data types
### Step 3: Study the relationships between each column and develop different questions based on the data.
### Step 4: Build worksheets in Tableau.
### Step 5: Build a dashboard and story in Tableau.


## Results
I picked option 3 with the Airbnb dataset. 

After studying the Dataset, I came up with the following questions and answered each by analyzing Tableau's data. 

The use case for this data:

If a business wants to buy an Airbnb place in New York City, where is the best place in NYC? What will be the ROI?

Factor 1:  How expensive is it for each zip code? - I filtered top 10 and bottom 10 price by zipcode. 

Factor 2: What are the top ratings by region?  - Overall Brooklyn has the highest rating, but the ratings change based on room types for all regions. 

Factor 3: How many rooms are available for each room type? Based on the data, Manhattan has the most bed availability for all the room types. It probably because Manhattan has the most Airbnb. 

Factor 4: Average Price from 2008 â€“ 2015 and forecasting 2016  - The prices of apartments and houses had some ups and downs over the years; however, the townhouse prices increased from $111/day in 2010 to $232.6/day in 2014.

## Challenges 
This Dataset is old; if I have more time, I will redo this project by using the most recent Dataset to build a model that reflects the current market. 


## Future Goals
This dataset does not provide a lot of information, if this is a real world project, I will redo this project by downloading the most recent Dataset from this link: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
